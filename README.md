Projets PowerBI

## Project 1 : 

Using Sales Data Analysis Project, companies are able to keep track of their sales and get answers to all of their questions about how they performed. As part of this project, we’ll be visualizing Microsoft’s sample dataset to show a profit by product and sales, as well as other key factors that may affect a company’s performance. However, the data set needs to be connected to Power BI Desktop so that irrelevant data can be removed before visualization and exporting of the filtered data as dashboards. There are various Power BI visualization types you could use for the dashboard, including Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Doughnut Charts, Funnel Charts, etc. Using the same sample dataset (Microsoft’s sample dataset), more Power BI projects can be developed and advanced visualizations can be made.

Tools : Power BI Desktop

## Project 2 :

A major challenge that modern enterprises face is customer migration (churn). Churn, or customer attrition, is the act of customers stopping purchasing from a business or interacting with it. What can we do to overcome this challenge? The idea is to know the reasons why customers churn, the factors that impact that, so that appropriate measures can be taken to retain them. This is where Power BI comes into play.

Through this Customer Churn analysis project, one can uncover what causes your customers to stop using your product or service. Business leaders, managers, or analytical users can use this Power BI project to analyze regional business growth and the profit distribution among customers. With the right visualization and data structure, they can receive extensive data. As part of the project, regional cash inflows will be considered, as well as product-specific churn over the course of time. To complete this beginner-friendly project, you will need the customer segmentation dataset.  In this project, Power BI data visualization options can be utilized for different scenarios as given below

Tools : SSIS , SSAS , Power BI

## Project 3 :

This Covid insight analysis project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic’s essential parameters and a detailed account of the situation at the national level. A Power BI dashboard can be created which displays valuable information regarding active cases, deceased cases, and recovered cases, as well as mortality and recovery rates by nation and timeframe. A dashboard can even provide a detailed analysis of the individual report pages, along with a management summary of the most important KPIs. It is an excellent project and makes you aware of how things are going. Heat Maps can also be used to enhance the dashboard visualization of your project.
